* 🛠️ Pre-configured essential settings like `.gitignore` & formatting configs
* 📦 Organized `package.json` to manage dependencies easily
* 🎯 Flexible — use any framework/middleware (Express, WebSockets, etc.)
* 🔄 Easy to scale into a complete backend project

## 🔧 Usage

Start writing your backend logic inside the `src/` folder — API routes, controllers, services, middleware, database connections, etc.

**Example:**

```javascript
// src/index.js
console.log("Backend Server Running... 🚀");
```

**Run the server:**

```bash
npm run dev
```

*(You can modify scripts in `package.json` as your project grows)*
